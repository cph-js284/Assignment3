# Assignment3
The 3rd assignment for PB soft2019spring

# 1. Twitter data.
*For an executable version of these queries please see repo for last assignment https://github.com/cph-js284/MongoDbQueries*
Since I already build the actual program, I will just be handing in the queries and the response - I will be using the following format:
 - first part: the mongo shell query, this can be copied directly into a running MongoDb shell and executed (provided the names of the database and collection match)
 - second part: the C# version of the query.
 - third part: the response from MongoDb.
